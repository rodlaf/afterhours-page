  <h1 id="privacy-policy">Privacy Policy</h1>

<p>Effective as of September 30th, 2022.</p>

<p>This Privacy Policy describes how Rodney Lafuente Mercado, referred to hereafter as Afterhours (
“we”, “us” or “our”) handles information that we collect through our digital properties that link to
this Privacy Policy, including our website and mobile application (collectively, the “Service”), as
well as through social media, and other activities described in this Privacy Policy. Afterhours may
provide additional or supplemental privacy policies to individuals for specific products or services
that we offer at the time we collect information.</p>

<h2 id="information-we-collect">Information we collect</h2>

<p>Information you provide to us. Information you may provide to us through the Service or otherwise
includes:</p>

<p>Contact data, such as your email address, school name, and phone number. Demographic Information,
such as your age. Communications that we exchange with you, including when you contact us through
the Service, social media, or otherwise. User-generated content, such as photos, images, videos,
comments, questions, messages, works of authorship, and other content or information that you
generate, transmit, or otherwise make available on the Service, as well as associated metadata.
Metadata includes information on how, when, where and by whom a piece of content was collected and
how that content has been formatted or edited. Metadata also includes information that users can add
or can have added to their content, such as keywords, geographical or location information, and
other similar data.</p>

<p>Third-party sources. We may combine information we receive from you with information we obtain from
other sources, such as social media services, that you link to your Service account. This data may
include your username, profile picture and other information associated with your account on that
third-party service that is made available to us based on your account settings on that service.</p>

<p>Automatic data collection. We, our service providers, and our business partners may automatically
log information about you, your computer or mobile device, and your interaction over time with the
Service, our communications and other online services, such as:</p>

<p>Device data, such as your computer’s or mobile device’s operating system type and version,
manufacturer and model, browser type, screen resolution, RAM and disk size, CPU usage, device type
(e.g., phone, tablet), IP address, unique identifiers (including identifiers used for advertising
purposes), language settings, mobile device carrier, radio/network information (e.g., Wi-Fi, LTE,
3G), and general location information such as city, state or geographic area. Online activity data,
such as pages or screens you viewed, how long you spent on a page or screen, navigation paths
between pages or screens, information about your activity on a page or screen, access times and
duration of access, and whether you have opened our emails or clicked links within them.</p>

<p>Cookies and similar technologies. Some of the automatic collection described above is facilitated by
the following technologies:</p>

<p>Cookies, which are small text files that websites store on user devices and that allow web servers
to record users’ web browsing activities and remember their submissions, preferences, and login
status as they navigate a site. Cookies used on our sites include both “session cookies” that are
deleted when a session ends, “persistent cookies” that remain longer, “first party” cookies that we
place and “third party” cookies that our third-party business partners and service providers place.
Local storage technologies, like HTML5, that provide cookie-equivalent functionality but can store
larger amounts of data on your device outside of your browser in connection with specific
applications. Web beacons, also known as pixel tags or clear GIFs, which are used to demonstrate
that a webpage or email was accessed or opened, or that certain content was viewed or clicked.</p>

<p>Data about others. We may offer features that help users invite their friends or contacts to use the
Service, and we may collect contact details about these invitees so we can deliver their
invitations. Please do not refer someone to us or share their contact details with us unless you
have their permission to do so.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-use-your-information">How we use your information</h2>

<p>We may use your information for the following purposes or as otherwise described at the time of
collection:</p>

on the Service; facilitate your invitations to friends who you want to invite to join the Service;

enable security features of the Service, such as by remembering devices from which you have
previously logged in; communicate with you about the Service, including by sending announcements,

de-identified data from your personal information and other individuals whose personal information
we collect. We make personal information into anonymous, aggregated or de-identified data by
removing information that makes the data identifiable to you. We may use this anonymous, aggregated
or de-identified data and share it with third parties for our lawful business purposes, including to
analyze and improve the Service and promote our business.</p>

You can learn more about Google Analytics and how to prevent the use of Google Analytics relating to
your use of our sites here: https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en.</p>

<p>Retention. We generally retain information to fulfill the purposes for which we collected it,
including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements, to
establish or defend legal claims, or for fraud prevention purposes. To determine the appropriate
retention period for information, we may consider factors such as the amount, nature, and
sensitivity of the information, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of
your information, the purposes for which we process your information and whether we can achieve
those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.</p>

<p>When we no longer require the information we have collected about you, we may either delete it,
anonymize it, or isolate it from further processing.</p>
